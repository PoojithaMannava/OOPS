#task is divided into components and solutions are find.
#object is real world entity.Every Object has properties and behaviour.

#attributes and methods are wrapped up together in an  so tha securiy is more. 
#class is like a blueprint for an object. 
#oops have extensibility feature. 
#data security 
#allows parallel programming in this every object is seperate. 
#modularity 
#reusability (we ca use one object many times it reduces the time and cost).
#mainaining software quality 
#oops have following concpts
#class and object 
#inheritance 
#polymorphism 
#encapsulation 
#abstraction
